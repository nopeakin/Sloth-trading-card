			<p class = "fact">The sloth is so named because of its very low
				metabolism and deliberate movements, sloth being related to the word
				 slow. This supports their low-energy diet of leaves and avoids
				 detection by predatory hawks and cats that hunt by sight.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span><strong>Scientific Name</strong></span>: folivora</li>
				<li><span><strong>Average Height</strong></span>: 23 inches</li>
				<li><span><strong>Average Lifespan</strong></span>: 25 years</li>
				<li><span><strong>Habitat</strong></span>: tropical rainforest</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All sloth species have long legs, and rounded heads with small ears.
				Their fur is long and coarse, and is frequently coated in green algae.
				This fur grows away from their extremities, unlike most other mammals.
				This strange growth pattern is attributed to their upside-down
				 style of living.</p>
